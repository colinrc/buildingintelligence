For the tabbar extension to be imported into an actionscript class file,
 the TabBar.as must be copied to:
"[Flash8 install directory]\Macromedia\Flash 8\en\First Run\Classes\mx\controls"

To use the Base64.as code, the Base64.as script file must appear in the project 
classpath. This is set in the "publish settings" dialog.
