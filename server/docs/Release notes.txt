''' Sign Video '''

Many bug fixes

''' Comms '''

Fixed bug where comms would not properly queue multiple serial 
messages if the system did not attend quickly enough to the 
message. Will impact many devices 

== Released [attachment:wiki:SoftwareReleases:eLife-1.6a14.zip V1.6a14] ==

''' Jetty '''

Ensure that multiple http get calls from the same session cannot conflict. if the session from a previous call is not yet complete the following call
will return an empty record set. Resolves Issue [ticket:490]

When there is no new instructions for the client to process the http return code will be set to SC_NOCONTENT. If there is content present it will be SC_OK.
In this way the get call can be processed extremely effeciently by the client. Completes enhancement [ticket:493]

''' Flash '''

Increased heartbeat speed to every 10 seconds. Need feedback from James if this is to fast for flash.


== Released [attachment:wiki:SoftwareReleases:eLife-1.6a13.zip V1.6a13] ==

''' General '''

Added daily maintenance task. An entry should be added to the bootstrap file specifying the time to run, if it is not specified the default time is 11:30PM
{{{
  <MAINTENANCE TIME="12:10" />
}}}

''' Calendar '''

Added active="Y|N" flag to calendar entries. The default is active="Y" if it is not specified.


''' Raw '''

Parameter handling changed to be the similar for processing catalogues from flash or from devices. HAL, Comfort, Nuvo, SignVideo and Kramer updated. Changes
should be transparent.
Added CUSTOM_CONNECT input methods
Base model refactored into two classes to improve readability, there will be no visible consequences.

Lookup and Scale abilities added for both INPUT and OUTPUT directions for CUSTOM_CONNECT items.

New Raw form is available to configuration with device type=Raw_Connection  or any model derived from the SimpleModel base type and using the 
updated methods. Currently only DMX uses these methods.


== Released [attachment:wiki:SoftwareReleases:eLife-1.6a12.zip V1.6a12] ==

''' Raw '''

Added a much simpler method for Raw processing using a new command CUSTOM_CONNECT. see [ServerDocs/CustomConnect] for details. This has been integrated 
into all Java models, Groovy model support and into the Java Raw model.  For all models, if the raw strings match from CUSTOM_CONNECT the model will not 
attempt to further process the message from the flash client. If the raw processing does not produce a result the model is called for more advanced processing.

LOOKUP does not yet function correctly 

Implementing issue [ticket:473]

''' General '''

Added a utility method to simplify reading Command object parameters, includes range checking and error messages. 
 * paramToInt

''' Build system '''

The build system has been updated to ensure the produced directory structure matches the structure used in client machines

== Released [attachment:wiki:SoftwareReleases:eLife-1.6a11.zip V1.6a11] ==

''' General '''

Added -vvv flag for enhanced debugging

''' Groovy '''
 
Initial groovy model support. Place .groovy model files into ''' models ''' directory.

''' Jetty '''

Jetty upgraded to 6 RC0.

Ensure macro status information is sent to web clients.
Ensure script status information is sent to web clients.

''' Macros '''

Fixed problem running macros.
Fixed various thread issues with macro update messages.
Resolved issues [ticket:460],[ticket:461]

''' Scripts '''

Fixed concurrent modification error for web clients with script messages.
Fixed 'element already has parent error'
Resolved issue [ticket:467],[ticket:468]

''' Comms '''

Fixed threadlock when sending 'complex' commands.


== Released [attachment:wiki:SoftwareReleases:eLife-1.6a7.zip V1.6a7] ==

''' Nuvo '''

Rectified issues with volume control. Complete enhancement [ticket:354]

''' Kramer '''

Updated to use common configuration catalogue support rather than model specific.

''' Jetty '''

Added correct number of session count handling for HTTPS clients.
Added "Too Many Clients" message when appropriate
Rewrote cache handler to support complex commands (eg. audio) as well as simple commands. Resolves issue [ticket:4]

''' System '''

Enforced stronger type checking in many places to make use of JDK5 type checking, for compile time type validation rather than run time exceptions.
Central command queue wrapped in an object to simplify later changes to a messaging bus, needed to support master/slave models and possible script engines running 
in seperate JVMs.

FormatKey updated to accept the device being called by the device factory.  The formatKey method in the model can be used to customise the key per device if required.
Resolved issue [ticket:444]

INPUT,OUTPUT,MONITORED,STARTUP types moved from the DeviceType interface to an enum, MessageDirection . This allows type checking and stops confusion with other 
DeviceType constants.   Various bugs were found and corrected as part of this process. 

Alarm type codes were moved from the DeviceType interface to their own enum; AlarmTypeCode.


== Released [attachment:wiki:SoftwareReleases:eLife-1.6a6.zip V1.6a6] ==

''' Comms '''

Added the ability for a model to specify the minimum time between packets to be sent to the device. This is to stop flooding device inputs. The value should be set before the 
device connection, the constructor is a reasonable place.

{{{
		this.setInterCommandInterval(10);
}}}


Improved IO exception handling for both serial and IP connections, the system should catch more errors and result in a system reconnection.


''' Jetty '''

Changed Jetty to HTTPS,  the certificate is placed in the datafiles directory in a file called keystore. It must have an access password of "building12".
WWWROOT has been removed from the bootfiles configuration, instead www is hard coded, the HTML wrapper file that delivers the flash file should be provided from this location.
A servlet to log out has been added; SERVERPATH/webclient/logout
A flag has been added to the bootstrap file to disable user name / password challenges, this is to facilitate flash development within the flash IDE which is incapable of providing this
information.
Servlet startup modified to expect a parameter INIT=x (anything). The flash client should not start updating until the initial response i received, this will guarantee session handling is 
correct.
The address book has been expanded to understand TCP / HTTP/ jabber connections for a user or client interface, this will facilitate messaging at a future stage.
A client redirect has been added /html will map to ../../Bi/Client/Lib/Html
Added an explicit logout servlet, it is mapped to /webclient/logout

== Released [attachment:wiki:SoftwareReleases:eLife-1.6a5.zip V1.6a5] ==

This release requires a new library set. Also download eLife-libs-1.6a5.zip

''' Jetty '''

Upraded Jetty to 6b17.
Initial jetty implementation; to retrieve a list of XML messages since the last request submit a get request to /webclient/update.
To post a new value sumbit a post request with MESSAGE="message string" to /webclient/update 
An username/password is required to access the update servlet, for the moment test using plain/plain.
The jetty server must be switched on in the bootstrap.xml file
For testing it may be useful to place a small HTML file in the www directory of the server. This will be served as the index file
(http://127.0.0.1:8081/)

{{{
<html>
  <head>
    <title>test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  <p>A test page for the update servlet.
  
  <FORM ACTION="http://127.0.0.1:8081/webclient/update" METHOD="POST" >

    	    but has not yet begun the individual device entries.)
    	
    Key formatting 
        FormatKey  (called automatically as the configuration file is read, formatting is based on the following parameters)
        setConfigKeysInDecimal    (if the keys have been specified as decimal rather than hex in the configuration file)
        setKeysInDecimal  (if the device expects decimal keys rather than the normal hex)

''' Macro '''

Revert macro's to sending macro list after saving


''' Logging '''

Try to ensure empty "severe error" messages are not sent to the flash client


''' Comms '''

Ensure comms device know their associated models for more meaninful error reporting.
IP and serial listener modified to support end byes markers larger than 128 (eg. 255 for Orgenon)

''' Alerts '''

Add single point to send alert and alarm messages. Simplifying later migration to persistent logging.


''' Calendar '''

== Released [attachment:wiki:SoftwareReleases:elife-server-1.5b12.zip V1.5b12] ==

''' Calendar '''

Added ID,category and alarm field.

Ensure alarm does not trigger if it is flagged as N.

Handle calendar files created before the new fields.

Add hourly and yearly recurrences.

 Resolved Issues: [ticket:7],[ticket:8]

''' Dynalite '''

Added ramp up / down for channels and areas

''' Scripts '''

Added validation to ensure script and macro handlers are not called if they have not yet fully initialised.

Improved error handling if a correct configuration script has not been specified.


2/2/2006
Released V1.5b11
Ensure macro, calendar and script lists are sent to the client for every client connection.


1/2/2006
Released V1.5b10

''' Security '''

Added a 3 minute grace period for flash client connections before the security message appears. This will allow
restarts of the client to not trigger a 'number of clients' security violation.

''' General Code '''

Added a hook for every model which is called on every new client connection, doClientStartup.

Removed AWT gui harness for main application, it is not longer used and caused maintenance problems.

Refactored configuration module to use factory singleton pattern, should facilitate testing.

Began to integrate a server ID concept to facilitate master slave development.

 
26/1/2006
Released V1.5b9
''' Calendar '''

Added the ability to store EXTRA, EXTRA2,EXTRA3, COMMAND fields in the calendar record. 

These are passed to the macro command when it runs. 

Extra4,EXTRA5 are unavailable as they are used internally to pass information to the running macro.

For example the following macro will switch the light passed in the extra field on. 

It will be set to the level specified in extra2, the macro will pause for the time specified
in extra3 then switch it off.

{{{
 <CONTROL KEY="MACRO" COMMAND="getList" EXTRA="Light On" TYPE="" STATUS="noDelete,noEdit" RUNNING="0">
    <CONTROL KEY="%EXTRA%" COMMAND="on" EXTRA="%EXTRA2%" EXTRA2="" EXTRA3="" EXTRA4="" EXTRA5="" />
        <CONTROL KEY="" COMMAND="pause" EXTRA="%EXTRA3%"  />
 <CONTROL KEY="%EXTRA%" COMMAND="off" EXTRA="" EXTRA2="" EXTRA3="" EXTRA4="" EXTRA5="" />
}}}

The appropriate calendar entry to run this macro once would be
 <event title="Test Light On" description="Test Light On" date="2006-01-26" time="15:41:16" eventType="once" macroName="Light On" extra="OFFICE_LIGHT" extra2="50" extra3="5" />


Calendar subsystem refactored to facilitate testing.

Added the ability to have the target control (ie. KEY) as a parameter.

Calendar entries now maintain their order through multiple saves.


20/1/2006
Released V1.5b8

''' Comms '''

Ensure IP receiver does not overflow buffer in receipt of very large or numerous packets.

Only resend a comms command that hasn't acknowleged 3 times before clearing the comamnd- ensures a rogue
command cannot block a device. (only applies with devices that acknowleging commands)

''' CBUS '''

Fix infinite memory usage from CBUS temperature polls if the cbus network does not reply.

Added POLL_TEMP_INTERVAL to CBUS configuration file, interval in seconds between polls.

Ensure CBUS connection going away will not cause null pointer in the cbus temperature probe.

''' Dynalite '''

Ensure a light level of 1% is interpretted as off.

Ensure correct behaviour for area fades.


14/1/2006
Corrected bug in IP listener for fixed length packets, if two packets were received before the 
first is processed it was possible for the second to overwrite the first. This could have effected
CBUS, Tutondo on protocol A, Dynalight, Pelco, when connected via IP.



12/1/2006
Released V1.5b7

''' Dynalite '''

Interpret preset changes from dynalite network.

Scan levels of devices in an area after preset change in an area.

''' CBUS '''

Added support for temperature sensors

Configuration syntax is
{{{
	<TEMPERATURE ACTIVE="Y" KEY="42" NAME="Temp Sensor2" DISPLAY_NAME="TEMP_SENSOR2" />
}}}

A message will be sent to the client whenever the temperature changes. Temperatures are reported in whole numbers only

{{{
	COMMAND="on" EXTRA="temperature"
}}}


''' Configuration '''

Added ANALOG synonym for ANALOGUE

Added AUDIO_OUTPUT synonym for AUDIO

Added AV_OUTPUT synonym for AV

Added CAMERA_INPUT synonym for CAMERA

Refactored configuration parser to be more modular.

Changed model DISPLAY_NAME to DESCRIPTION; DISPLAY_NAME can still be used

Changed model NAME to DEVICE_TYPE; NAME can still be used


2005/12/18
Released V1.5b6

''' Named Clients '''

Infrastructure support for named clients has been added.

If a client sends a CONTROL message with KEY="ID" COMMAND="name" EXTRA="name for the client" the address book 
will be updated with this information.

If a client sends a CONTROL message with KEY="ID"  COMMAND="user" EXTRA="user name" the address book will
be updated with this information.

The fields TARGET and TARGET_USER have been added to all client XML packets, initially only MESSAGE control 
types will be useful. Underlying support for TARGET_USER has not yet been fully implemented, more functionality
is required for it to be fully useful.

If a TARGET is specified and a MESSAGE command is sent from the client; it will be conveyed to the TARGET.

A target of All sends the message to all clients apart from the orginating client. -1 is the default if
no specific target has been specified.

A target of All_Inc_Src sends the message to all clients, this may prove to not be useful.

Message structure is
{{{
	<MESSAGE TARGET="Kitchen" TITLE="Test" HIDECLODE="TRUE" AUTOCLOSE="5" ICON="" CONTENT="Hello" />
    <MESSAGE TARGET="Lounge" TITLE="Test" HIDECLODE="TRUE" AUTOCLOSE="5" ICON="" CONTENT="Hello" />
	<MESSAGE TARGET="All" TITLE="Test" HIDECLODE="TRUE" AUTOCLOSE="5" ICON="" CONTENT="Hello" />
}}}

	The flash identification command is as follows. This should be sent as soon as possible after initial 
	connection to facilitate messaging.
{{{
	<CONTROL KEY="ID" COMMAND="name" EXTRA="Lounge"  />
	<CONTROL KEY="ID" COMMAND="name" EXTRA="Kitchen"  />
}}}

''' Calendar '''

Added ability for the calendar to skip dates.

Add <skip start_date="yyyy-mm-dd" end_date="yyyy-mm-dd" /> elements to the particular event XML block.

Muliple skip elements can be added to an event; all dates are inclusive.


''' Dynalite Initial Release '''

Dynalite understands ordinary light commands; off/on level.

Fade times can also be given in the extra2 message field, fades can be minutes or seconds; eg. EXTRA2="10m" instructs the
fade to occur over 10 minutes. EXTRA2="10" will indicate 10 seconds. Most dynalite commands support up to 28 minutes for 
fades.

Fades originating from the dynalite network will send messages to flash with the fade time included in EXTRA2.

Lights are configured as follows

{{{
	<LIGHT_DYNALITE ACTIVE="Y" KEY="01" AREA="01" NAME="Garage Light" DISPLAY_NAME="GARAGE_LIGHT" POWER_RATING="100"/>
}}}
 
Area commands are supported using key=0-; fades to this key will operate on all lights in the area, and any linked areas.

Area commands originating in the dynalite network will be sent to that key.

  
Presets are supported;  eg.  command="preset" extra="preset_number" 

Switching an area off using preset 4 is the preferred way to switch lights off in an area when the dynalite network has been
configured in this manner (recomended by dynalite). 

Preset changes should be sent to the area key configured as described above as presets operate on areas, not individual 
channels.

Classic presets pay attention to offset levels in the same manner as the Dynalite network.

Fade times can given for preset switching in the EXTRA2 field in the same manner as light fades.

Preset changes in the network are returned to flash with the same structure.

Classic preset offset commands are supported. Send command="preset" extra="preset_number" , the target device should
be the area device controlling a particular area number (ie . channel 0)  


Classic and Linear protocols are supported, their is a parameter in the config file to which protocol to use for message
generation. The system will always interpret both.
{{{
	<ITEM NAME="PROTOCOL" VALUE="Linear | Classic" />
}}}

All command can accept a join parameter in EXTRA3; the value will be passed directly to dynalite, see dynalite documentation
for join details.

All commands originating in the system will have the join parameter sent back to the client, a script writer may wish to use
this value.


Switch and IR commands send on/off messages as applicable to the flash client. The switches must be configured in the
dynalite network to send a key message. For example to listen to box 01, key 01. press/release actions on the button will 
generate on/off messages to BUTTON_1
{{{
	<CONTACT_CLOSURE ACTIVE="Y" KEY="01" BOX="01" NAME="Button 1" DISPLAY_NAME="BUTTON_1" />
}}}

Todo.

Area Linking

Alarm Messages

Determinine light levels after preset switch.

''' Security '''

Fixed bug where number of clients is not correctly counted if clients connecct within the first 30 seconds of
server startup and never reboot.

''' Bugs '''

Ensure script handler will not crash if the config file specified in the bootstrap file is not found.

Fixed bug with serial handler; will possibly oregon scientific handling. 


2005/11/30
Enabled security for number of clients using HASP key

Released V1.5b5

2005/11/27
Macros calls no longer list all macros for run,abort or complete commands. Instead the macro started and finished 
messages are only transmitted.

Macros can be run with a 'virtual name' to differentiate multiple instances of the same running macro. Run the 
macro with EXTRA="macro_name:label". macro_name will be used to identify the true macro to run whereas the entire 
field (macro_name=label" will be used to communicate start and finish messages to the client. 

For example. 
A macro is called on_light you would like to call it from two buttons on the client
one would generate 
{{{
   COMMAND="run" EXTRA="on_light:LOUGE_LIGHT" 
   the other could be COMMAND="run" EXTRA="on_light:GARAGE_LIGHT"
}}}

Added macro pause based on a passed in value for the length (passed in via the EXTRA field)

Ugraded quartz scheduling library to version 1.5.1

''' 2005/11/23 Released V1.5b4 '''

Memory location 0 is number of clients

Bug with two GC100 IR modules rectified



''' 2005/9/30 Released version 0.9.235 '''

Updates to suppport Kramer model

Ensure input names for both audio and video catalogues are correct, when using extra="AV" or extra="" commands (rather 
then VIDEO_ONLY or AUDIO_ONLY) both catalogues will be checked for the input name. For simplicity it is recomended you
connect AV units to the same input number for both audio and video.

Commands are 

preset selection. 
{{{
	COMMAND="preset" EXTRA="#preset number" EXTRA2="#machine_number#"  (should be sent to the ALL device)
}}}

src          
{{{
	COMMAND="src" EXTRA="#source name#" EXTRA2="#machine number#" EXTRA3="AV|AUDIO_ONLY|VIDEO_ONLY"
}}}

The kramer block should be similar to this

''' 2005/9/25 Released version 0.9.234 '''

Improved logging for binary IO to all serial devices.

Significant refactoring within script model. No changes were made to the script interpretter, or API interface to flash 
client or other system components.

Scripts will now queue if attempted to run again when it is currently running. Up to 4 times will be queued. More than
4 will be ignored.

If a script must not be queued, send no_queue in the extra parameter of the script run.

 * (a) Scan. The default is for auto scan.
 * (b) Not all devices pay attention to an absolute number.
 * (c) Speed. 0 is very slow, not stationary.
 * (d) Many devices support more than 32 presets.

Cameras must be specied in the PELCO block of the config file. The format is


{{{
<CAMERA ACTIVE="Y" KEY="1" DISPLAY_NAME="FRONT_CAMERA" ZOOM="b8" />
}}}


This represents a camera listening on address1, with a zoom capability of 148

Following is a test macro; this will switch on the camera listening on address 0 ; 

It will start it panning left for 5 seconds

It will then stop the pan and switch off.

''' 2005/9/14 Released version 0.9.232 '''

Improved logging for messages containing unprintable characters.

Resend instructions which have not been attended to in a reasonable time


''' 2005/9/14 Released version 0.9.231 '''

Fixed errors in adding CBUS devices to the system when parsing the config file


''' 2005/9/13 Released version 0.9.230 '''

Can now send multiple IR codes from one instruction. Use commas between instructions. This would generally be used to select a 2 digit
channel or station.

eg. 

{{{
<item type="button" icon="volume-up" command="AV.STUDY_IR" extra="Philips MC-200.VOLUP,Philips MC-200.CD" repeatRate="200" />
}}}

Added Kramer preset selection. COMMAND="preset" EXTRA="#preset number" EXTRA2="#machine_number#" 
extra 2 is optional



Added Dynalite commands
{{{
	COMMAND="preset" EXTRA="#preset#" EXTRA2="#fade rate#" EXTRA3="#join#" 
	COMMAND="on" EXTRA="#level#" EXTRA2="#fade rate#" EXTRA3="#join#" 
	COMMAND="off" EXTRA="" EXTRA2="#fade rate#" EXTRA3="#join#" 
}}}
join defaults through to 255.

fade rate ranges from 0.02 to 65535 seconds. This is rounded to the nearest 0.02 seconds.
     rate can be expressed as minutes  eg. 2m


Corrected errors in GC100 log messages

Corrected problems in handling of queued comms messages

Ensured GC100 IR strings are queue accross multiple IR ports, rather than in parrallel. Should solve issues with
GC100s being used to drive devices on multiple IR port within a single macro/script





 
''' 2005/8/25 Released version 0.9.229 '''

Extra HAL debugging added

Added ability for scripts to run more than once simultaneously, set EXTRA2=no_lock in the script call

First release kramer module. 

Commands are 

 * COMMAND="volume" EXTRA="up/down/level" (level is 0-99) EXTRA2="machine number"
 * COMMAND="bass" EXTRA="up/down/level" (level is 0-99) EXTRA2="machine number" 
 * COMMAND="src" EXTRA="input source" EXTRA2="machine number" EXTRA3="AV/AUDIO_ONLY/VIDEO_ONLY" default is AV

if AV,VIDEO_ONLY or an empty string is used in EXTRA3 the AV_INPUTS catalogue will be used to map the source name to an inupt 
channel. if AUDIO_ONLY is specified the AUDIO_INPUTS catalogue will be used. This allows audio only devices to be specified in a 
meaningful way.

Machine number is only needed if multiple switches have been daisy chained to one RS232 port.
Ouput number is determined by the key specified in the configuration file; output of 0 is used to switch an input to every output.
Audio and video commands refer to the output circuit rather than the inputs, 
eg. the output volume for a particular screen is increased.

Added macro parameters. If a field in a command from the macro contains %EXTRA2%,%EXTRA3% the value will be 
replaced with the corresponding field from the command object that ran the MACRO. If the macro contains %COMMAND% or %EXTRA%
they value will be read from the EXTRA4 or EXTRA5 field respectively. (The COMMAND and EXTRA fields are unavailable as they are 
used to specify running the MACRO). 




2005/7/25

Tutodono send_audio_command can now be directed to a SUF/TIF slot rather than the currently selected source,
  put EXTR2="..." with the source label you with the instruction to go to. eg. EXTRA2="digital". This will generally
  be used for a macro or a script setting up characteristics before switching source.
  If extra2 is not specified or is empty the instruction will default to the program (source) currently selected.

HAL handling of send_audio_command has been updated in the same manner. 
Ensure GC100 does not attempt to process commands not meant for it (remove GC100 received command it did not understand error)

IR port on the GC100.
