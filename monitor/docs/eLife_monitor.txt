eLife_monitor. 
Development notes.



The eLife_monitor application is an extremely small java application that listens on port 10002 for 
connections. The monitor should be configured as a auto-restarting service using the java service wrapper.

To run the application:
java eLife_monitor

Currently support commands
All file operations only operate on config, scripts and datafiles directories. 
The exception is delete which will only operate on config and scripts.

LIST . If a top level comment is present in the file
it will be listed. eg. <DESC>some comments</DESC>
START
STOP 
RESTART
EXIT (leaves the monitor application, the service should be configured to restart automatically)
DELETE
UPLOAD (attatch the XML file as a child to the <ADMIN.... > root element. Scripts are not yet supported.
DOWNLOAD (the file will be attatched to the root element<FILE NAME="..."/> . Scripts are not yet supported.
SELECT (EXTRA should have the appropriate file to be set as the bootup configuration)

XML syntax is
<ADMIN COMMAND="..." DIR="..." EXTRA="..." />
Not all commands require a directory to be specified.

Commands are simple to ensure maximum reliability of this application.

Errors are returned in a <ERROR> ... </ERROR> block if required

All commands will return some indication, if the command does not by nature retun information (for example file delete
or upload) , a success message will be returned. eg. <DELETE RESULT="SUCCESS" />
